This plugin gives you the ability to set Meta Keywords in WordPress. Under pages it will registrate a separate taxonomy for keywords.

== Description ==

This plugin will make it possible to use tags as `meta keywords`. Under `Pages` you will find a new meta box called `Keywords`.
By activation the plugin registrates a separate taxonomy which is independent from post tags.
Today's search engines don't use `meta keywords` as a criteria at all, but who knows for what they will be good in future ;)
For me tagging is necessary to bring pages in relation and gives me the possibility to save my tags redundant in the database.

**Features**

* Use post tags as `meta keywords`
